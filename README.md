This is my own implementation of the projects in the Nand2Tetris course.
A bunch of comments were made in the code because sources online didn't help explain the principles behind how things work (like in Project 2, ALU).
Yes, yes, I know Uncle Bob will be displeased that I had to comment on the code when it should be explanatory but I figured if I went through those hoops then maybe someone else shouldn't have to, hence the comments.
Honestly this was recommend by my uni before we began our CS program so I'm doing this as a fun little project.
Maybe I will implement them all in Python and C, maybe not. Anyway, thanks for reading, I hope you like it.
